This is modified from https://github.com/hbhbnr/binary2video


1) I've modified to prepend a fixed-size header to the binary data before sending it to FFmpeg. This header will contain the file size information. This is needed to correctly decode as buffer data is added to ensure the total size is a multiple of the video frame size, and removes the need to gzip the input file as the original script did. 
2) added H265 with lossless tag
3) modified video2binay logic to read the header for correct original file size and trim the unneeded buffer data to ensure the file matches the original input.

usage remains the same, but now you can use -c h265

# binary2video
Convert binary files to videos, e.g. MP4/WebM/AVI/MKV, and back, with the help of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). Supports h.264, VP9, FFV1 level 1 and 3 video codecs.

## Usage

### binary2video

```
binary2video [-f fps] [-w width] [-h height] [-v] infile outfile

-f fps      Set framerate, i.e. frames per second; default 1.

-w width    Set width, default 320.

-h height   Set height, default 240.

-c codec    Set video codec: h264, vp9, ffv1, or ffv1l3. Default is vp9.

-v          Be verbose.

infile      The name and path of the binary file which should be converted into
            a video.

outfile     The name and path of the video file which should be created. The suffix
            of the file will determine the video container type. The container must
            be supported by FFmpeg, for example .mp4, .webm, .avi, .mkv, etc. Not
            all video codecs work with all container formats, though.
```

### video2binary

```
video2binary [-v] infile outfile

-v          Be verbose.

infile      The name and path of the video file from which the original binary file
            should be extracted.

outfile     The name and path of the binary file to which the original data should be
            restored to.
```

## Installation

Copy `binary2video` and `video2binary` to a directory of your path, for example to `/usr/local/bin/`, and make them executable. Expects FFmpeg at `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`.

## Examples

### Basic example

Encode `LICENSE` into a .webm video with default settings:

    binary2video LICENSE LICENSE.webm

Decode `LICENSE_restored` from the .webm video:

    video2binary LICENSE.webm LICENSE_restored

Verify the original file and the restored file are identical:

    md5sum LICENSE LICENSE_restored
    1ebbd3e34237af26da5dc08a4e440464  LICENSE
    1ebbd3e34237af26da5dc08a4e440464  LICENSE_restored

### Example with parameters

Encode [KeePass-2.56.zip](https://keepass.info/) into a .mp4 video with 0.5 frames
per second, 640 x 360 pixels frame size, using the h.264 codec:

    binary2video -f 0.5 -w 640 -h 360 -c h264 KeePass-2.56.zip KeePass-2.56.zip.mp4

Decode `KeePass-2.56.zip_restored` from .mp4 video:

    video2binary KeePass-2.56.zip.mp4 KeePass-2.56.zip_restored

Verify the original file and the restored file are identical:

    md5sum KeePass-2.56.zip KeePass-2.56.zip_restored
    d0c2b3155838aa7f59f35d52a5484d2e  KeePass-2.56.zip
    d0c2b3155838aa7f59f35d52a5484d2e  KeePass-2.56.zip_restored

## Compatibility matrix

| Container vs. Codec | **h264** | **vp9** | **ffv1** | **ffv1l3** |
|--------------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| **.mp4**            | ✓        | ✓       |          |            |
| **.webm**           |          | ✓       |          |            |
| **.avi**            | ✓        | ✓       | ✓        | ✓          |
| **.mkv**            | ✓        | ✓       | ✓        | ✓          |

Other containers have not been tested but may also work.

## Internal process

### Conversion from binary file to video file
1. Compress original binary file with `gzip` to wrap the file into an archive with
minimal compression. This adds checksums and the original file size.
2. If needed, pad the compressed file with zero bytes to align with the next full video frame. Padding is calculated depending on the used frame size and bit depth.
The framerate is not relevant.
3. Read padded data with FFmpeg using the `rawvideo` demuxer with 24 bit depth and write it to a video container, encoded with one of the lossless video encoders.

### Conversion from video file to binary file
1. Read video data with FFmpeg. Frame size and bit depth are taken from the container
automatically.
2. Write data with the `rawvideo` demuxer with 24 bit depth to a compressed file. The compressed file contains the padding data which has been added to align with the next
full video frame before.
3. Uncompress the compressed data with `gzip` to restore the original binary file.
The padding data is automatically ignored because the archive contains the original
file size.

## Unit testing
The unit tests need the [Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).
